## 2025/5/3 Motion models vs. target models

* NCV(1) target shows perfect NEES match with the CV(1) motion model;
  ~95% of mean NEES falls into the 95% confidence interval
* for the CV target and CV(1) motion model (truly constant-velocity
  target, no noise), there is an exchange between NEES being within
  the confidence interval (which means that the reported covariance
  matrix accurately represents the actual estimation error) and the
  actual error; this happens for mismatched motion / target models
