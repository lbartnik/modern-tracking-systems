    "Based on your specifications—simulating aerial targets with diverse trajectories (straight lines, turns, slicebacks) impacted by random noise, and creating a realistic testbed for state estimation and data association—I’ll recommend high-quality open-source projects and libraries that implement physics-based movement for aerial targets. These either directly match your needs or can be adapted with minimal effort. I’ll also highlight any scenario libraries they provide. Since your focus is on aerial targets, I’ll prioritize tools with strong support for 3D motion, dynamics, and noise modeling, suitable for applications like UAVs or aircraft.\n",

    "### Adapting to Your Specifications\n",
    "Here’s how you can tailor these tools to your needs:\n",
