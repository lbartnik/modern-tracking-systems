1. notebook "09 MHT State Estimation Metrics": test the difference between mean NEES
   across N runs and matching Chi-squared for a sequence of R_sigma

2. calibrate autopilot target to follow a straight line to test MHT with that
   target rather than near-constant velocity

3. should Autopilot scale random disturbance with the norm of velocity?
